Although we have done our best to document as much as possible here in the documentation, it is inevitable that there will be questions we have not answered.  We want to be accessible as possible, so we have several methods to reach the developers in order to get help directly:

## Forum

We have a new [real-time forum solution](http://getgrav.org/forum) utilizing the **Muut** platform to provide a simple way to get your Grav questions answered quickly.

## Twitter

We **highly recommend** you [follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/getgrav) as that provides a real-time way for us to reach out to our followers and let them know about news and events related to Grav development.

## Grav Blog

You can join in a discussion on any of the topics we post about on the [Grav Development Blog](http://getgrav.org/blog), via the comments.  We will post all major news and information to our blog, as well as useful posts about development in general. We also plan to share great tutorials and hints about how get the most out of Grav.

## GitHub Issues

If you find a bug, have a general question, or even if you want to contribute to the Grav project as a whole, you can use the [Grav GitHub Issues tracker](https://github.com/getgrav/grav/issues).  We are very diligent about responding to issues posted here, and it can provide a useful way to start a conversation with us.  If you have a specific issue with one of our plugins, themes, or skeletons, you can also submit an issue on that repository.

## Chat on Gitter.im

You can **chat with us live** on [Gitter.im](https://gitter.im/getgrav/grav). Gitter.im is a great new chat tool that is tightly coupled with GitHub so you will need to create a free GitHub account if you don't already have one.  Once done, you can use the [https://gitter.im/getgrav/grav](https://gitter.im/getgrav/grav) URL or you can download one of their [native apps](https://gitter.im/apps).
