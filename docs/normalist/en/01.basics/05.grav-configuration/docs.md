All Grav configuration files are written in [YAML syntax](../../advanced/yaml) with a `.yaml` file extension.  YAML is very intuitive which makes it very easy to both read and write, however, you can check out the [YAML page in the Advanced chapter](../../advanced/yaml) to get a complete understanding of the syntax available.

## System Configuration

Grav focuses on making things as easy as possible for the user, and the same goes for configuration.  Grav comes with some sensible default options and these are contained in a file that resides in the `system/config/system.yaml` file.

However, **you should never change this file**, rather any configuration changes you need to make should be stored in a file called `user/config/system.yaml`.  Any setting in this file with the same structure and naming will override the setting provided in the default system configuration file.

>>>> Generally speaking you should **NEVER** change anything in the `system/` folder.  All things the user does (creating content, installing plugins, editing configuration, etc.) should be done in the `user/` folder.  This way it allows simpler upgrading and also keeps your changes all in one location for backing up, synchronizing, etc.

Here's the default `system/config/system.yaml` file:

```ruby
absolute_urls: false                   # Absolute or relative URLs for `base_url`
timezone: ''                           # Valid values: http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php

>>> You do not need to copy the **entire** configuration file to override it, you can override as little or as much as you like.  Just ensure you have the **exact same naming structure** for the particular setting you want to override.

## Site Configuration

As well as the `system.yaml` file, Grav also provides a default `site.yaml` configuration file that is used to set some front-end specific configuration such as author name, author email, as well as some key taxonomy settings.  You can override these in the same way as you would the system.yaml by providing your own configuration file in `user/config/site.yaml`. You can also use this file to put in arbitrary configuration options that you may want to reference from your content or templates.

The default `system/config/site.yaml` file that ships with Grav looks something like this:

```ruby
title: Grav                                 # Name of the site
author:
  name: John Appleseed                      # Default author name
  email: 'john@email.com'                   # Default author email
taxonomies: [category,tag]                  # Arbitrary list of taxonomy types
blog:
  route: '/blog'                            # Route to blog
metadata:
  description: 'My Grav Site'               # Site description
summary:
  enabled: true                             # enable or disable summary of page
  format: short                             # long = summary delimiter will be ignored; short = use the first occurence of delimter or size
  size: 300                                 # Maximum length of summary (characters)
  delimiter: ===                            # The summary delimiter
routes:
  /something/else: '/blog/sample-3'         # Alias for /blog/sample-3
  /another/one/here: '/blog/sample-3'       # Another alias for /blog/sample-3
  /new/*: '/blog/*'                         # Wildcard any /new/my-page URL to /blog/my-page Route
```

Let's break down the elements of this sample file:

| Field                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| :----------          | :----------                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **title:**           | The title is a simple string variable that can be referenced whenever you want to display the name of this site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **author: name:**    | The name of the author of the site, that can be referenced whenever you need it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **author: email:**   | A default email for use in your site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **taxonomies:**      | An arbitrary list of high-level types that you can use to organize your content.  You can assign content to specific taxonomy types, for example, categories or tags. Feel free to edit, or add your own.                                                                                                                                               |
| **metadata:**        | Set default metadata for all your pages, see the [content page headers](../../content/headers) section for more details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **summary: size:**   | A variable to override the default number of characters that can be used to set the summary size when displaying a portion of content.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **routes:**          | This is a basic map that can provide simple URL alias capabilities in Grav.  If you browse to `/something/else` you will actually be sent to `/blog/sample-3`. Feel free to edit, or add your own as needed. **Wildcards** (`*`) are now supported at the end of route aliases.  You should put these at the bottom of the list for optimal performance |
| **(custom options)** | You can create any option you like in this file and a good example is the `blog: route: '/blog'` option that is accessbile in your Twig templates with `blog.route`                                                                                                                                                                                     |

>>> For most people, the most important element of this file is the `Taxonomy` list.  The taxonomies in this list **must** be defined here if you wish to use them in your content.

## Other Configuration Settings and Files

User configuration is completely optional. You can override as little or as much of the default settings as you need. This applies to both the system, site, and any plugin configurations in your site.

You are also not limited to the `user/config/system.yaml` or the `user/config/site.yaml` files as described above. You can create any arbitrary `.yaml` configuration file in the `user/config` folder you wish and it will get picked up by Grav automatically.

Paths to the configuration files will be used as a **namespace** for your configuration options.

Alternatively, you can put all the options into one file and use YAML structures to specify the hierarchy for your configuration options. This namespacing is built from a combination of the **path + filename + option name**.

For example: An option such as `author: Frank Smith` in file `plugins/myplugin.yaml` could be accessible via: `plugins.myplugin.author`. However, you could also have a `plugins.yaml` file and in that file have a option name called `myplugin: author: Frank Smith` and it would still be reachable by the same `plugins.myplugin.author` namespace.

Some example configuration files could be structured:

| Filename                              | Description                                       |
| :----------                           | :----------                                       |
| **user/config/system.yaml**           | Global system configuration file                  |
| **user/config/site.yaml**             | A site-specific configuration file                |
| **user/config/plugins/myplugin.yaml** | Individual configuration file for myplugin plugin |

>>> Having a namespaced configuration file will override or mask all options having the same path in the default configuration files

Most plugins will come with their own YAML configuration file. We recommend copying this file to the **user/config/plugins/** directory rather than editing configuration options directly to the file located in the plugin's directory. Doing this will ensure that an update to the plugin will not overwrite your settings, and keep all of your configurable options in one, convenient place.

The YAML file that exists within the plugin's primary directory will act as a fallback. Any settings listed there and not in the User folder's copy will be picked up and used by Grav.
